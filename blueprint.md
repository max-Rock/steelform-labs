## Project Outline

### Version 1.0: Initial Build

*   **Header:**
    *   A clean, minimalist header containing the company logo, "Steelform Labs."
    *   Styled with a black background, white text, and a `max-width` of `1200px` for a consistent, centered look.
    *   Fully responsive, with a hamburger menu for seamless navigation on screens smaller than `1024px`.
*   **Hero Section:**
    *   A full-screen hero section designed to make a bold first impression.
    *   Features a compelling headline: "Let's rebuild America's metal independence."
    *   Includes a prominent "Contact Us" button to drive user engagement.
    *   A high-impact background image of metal fabrication is displayed on the right side, occupying 50% of the screen width on desktops.
    *   The left side, containing the headline and button, has a solid black background.
    *   On screens smaller than `1024px`, the layout stacks vertically, with the content centered.
*   **Footer:**
    *   A full-width, responsive footer with a sophisticated layout.
    *   **Desktop & Tablet (768px and up):** A two-column design with left-aligned text content and a full-height image on the right.
    *   **Mobile (below 768px):** A layered design where the left-aligned text content is placed directly on top of the full-width footer image. A dark overlay ensures text readability while maintaining a modern aesthetic.
